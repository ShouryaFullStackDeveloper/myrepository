                        international cricketer
                        who plays for the
                        Indian cricket team in all formats of the game. A right-arm fast bowler with a unique bowling
                        action, Bumrah
                        is widely regarded as one of the best bowlers in the world and as one of the greatest fast
                        bowlers India has
                        ever produced.[4] He plays for Gujarat in domestic cricket and for Mumbai Indians in the Indian
                        Premier
                        League (IPL).

                        Bumrah is the fastest Indian pacer to take 150 wickets in Test cricket and the second fastest
                        Indian bowler
                        to reach 100 wickets in One-Day International cricket. He also holds the record of scoring the
                        highest runs
                        in an over in Test cricket. As of March 2024, he is the highest-ranked bowler in the ICC Test
                        player
                        rankings and the first bowler to achieve the number one ranking in all three formats of the
                        game.

                        Bumrah made his domestic debut in 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and also helped his side
                        clinch its maiden
                        title victory. His first-class debut came against Vidarbha, during the 2013–14 season of the
                        Ranji Trophy.
                        Bumrah was signed by the Mumbai Indians (MI) for the 2013 season of the IPL. Since then, he has
                        played for
                        MI, contributing to the team's title wins five times. He is the second-highest wicket-taker for
                        MI, behind
                        Lasith Malinga, with 145 wickets in 120 matches.</p></u>

                        Pakistan.

                        His father, Mohammad Akhtar, whom Shoaib describes as very religious and “from a hardworking,

                        children: four sons, Shoaib being the fourth, followed by a daughter, while his name, which in
                        Arabic means
                        both “the one who brings people together” and “the one who separates”, was chosen by his
                        mother.[7]</u></P>
