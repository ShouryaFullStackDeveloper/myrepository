            Shah Rukh Khan is an Indian actor, producer and television personality who works in
            Hindi films.[1] He began
            his acting career by playing a soldier in the Doordarshan series Fauji (1988), a role that garnered him
            recognition and led to starring roles in more television shows.[2] He soon started receiving film offers and
            had his first release with the romantic drama Deewana (1992), in which he played a supporting part.[3][4]
            Khan subsequently played villainous roles in the 1993 thrillers Baazigar and Darr, box office successes that
            established his career in Bollywood.[5] In 1995, Khan starred opposite Kajol in Aditya Chopra's romance
            Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, that became the longest running Indian film of all time.[6] He continued to
            establish a reputation in romantic roles by playing opposite Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), and
            Kajol in the Karan Johar-directed Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001).[7][8]

            In 1999, Khan collaborated with Aziz Mirza and Juhi Chawla to start a production company, Dreamz Unlimited,
            whose first release was the comedy-drama Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000) starring Khan and Chawla.[9] The
            film was a commercial failure as was their next production, Aśoka (2001), leading to a setback.[10] His
            career prospects improved in 2002 when he starred alongside Dixit and Aishwarya Rai in Devdas, a period
            romance that garnered him critical acclaim.[11] In 2004, he collaborated with his wife Gauri Khan to launch
            another company, Red Chillies Entertainment, whose first feature was the box office hit Main Hoon Na
            (2004).[12][13] Khan's popularity continued to increase in the 2000s as he played the romantic lead opposite
            younger actresses,[14] most notably Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta, in several top-grossing productions,
            including Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006).[15][16][17] He also
            played against type as a NASA scientist in the drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports film Chak
            De! India (2007), and an autistic man in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010).[18]</p></u>

            Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]), known professionally as Akshay
            Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema. Referred
            to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in
            over 100 films and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. He
            received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar
            is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both
            highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and
            2020, he was the only Indian on both lists.[9][10][11]

            Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the
            action thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in
            the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although
            his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that
            Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz
            (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera
            Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is
            Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in
            Garam Masala (2005).</u></p>

            Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (pronounced [səlˈmɑːn xɑːn]; born 27 December 1965)[3] is an Indian actor,
            film producer, and television personality who works predominantly in Hindi films. In a career spanning over
            three decades, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards as a film producer, and
            a Filmfare Award as an actor.[4] He is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors
            of Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes has included Khan in listings of the highest-paid celebrities in the world,
            in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked Indian in the latter year.[7][8][9][10] Khan has starred
            in the annual highest-grossing Hindi film of 10 individual years, the highest for any actor.[11]

            Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), followed by his breakthrough
            with a leading role in Sooraj Barjatya's romance Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). He established himself in the
            1990s, with several commercially successful films, including Barjatya's family dramas Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!
            (1994) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999), the action film Karan Arjun (1995) and the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999).
            After a period of fluctuations in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by starring in the
            top-grossing action films Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2
            (2012), Kick (2014), and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and dramas such as Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan
            (2016). This was followed by a series of poorly-received films, with the exception of the sequel Tiger 3
            (2023).</u></p>
