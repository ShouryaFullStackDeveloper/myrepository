    <li style="font-family: cursive; color:#FFF3C7;">SACHIN TENDULKAR</li>
    <p style="font-family: cursive; color: #FFF3C7;"><u>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ⓘ; pronounced
            [sətɕin
            teːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an
            Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one
            of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] Hailed as the world's most prolific batsman of all
            time, he is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and
            15,000 runs, respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most player of the match awards in
            international cricket.[6] Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from 2012 to
            2018.[7][8]

            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against
            Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
            internationally for over 24 years.[9] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the
            second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
            time, behind Viv Richards.[10] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the
            joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team
            that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had
            previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup.</u></p>
